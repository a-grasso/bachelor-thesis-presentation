# Construction of a software solution for detection of end-of-support dependencies

---

- ***Context***: 
dependency management
<br>
- ***Goal***:
tooling to problem-solve
<br>
- ***Demarcation***:
not full-fletched, rather pioneering

---

# Problem Definition

---

- ***Focus***:
end-of-support dependencies

---

- ***Why***:
risk, expense & cost
in management, development & planning

---

... e.g. **issues** with, and **concerns** about

- common vulnerabilities and exposures
    - compliance
- stability
    - bugs without fixes or patches
- compatibility
    - out-datedness and actuality

<br>

***-> risk***

---

... **consequenting** 

- replacement

- upgrading

- independent fixes and patches

<br>

***-> expense & cost***

---

- ***Solution***:
mitigating the impact of consequences from
end-of-support dependency

---

# Methods

---

- ***What***:
a software solution 
to detect end-of-support dependencies

---

- ***How***:
project-based <> automation <> independence
